    A column suitable for rendering boolean data.

    Arguments:
        null (bool): is `None` different from `False`?
        yesno (str): comma separated values string or 2-tuple to display for
                     True/False values.

    Rendered values are wrapped in a ``<span>`` to allow customization by using
    CSS. By default the span is given the class ``true``, ``false``.

    In addition to *attrs* keys supported by `~.Column`, the following are
    available:

     - ``span`` -- adds attributes to the ``<span>`` tag
