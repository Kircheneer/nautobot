    Attempts to render `.FieldFile` (or other storage backend `.File`) as a
    hyperlink.

    When the file is accessible via a URL, the file is rendered as a
    hyperlink. The `.basename` is used as the text, wrapped in a span::

        <a href="/media/path/to/receipt.pdf" title="path/to/receipt.pdf">receipt.pdf</a>

    When unable to determine the URL, a ``span`` is used instead::

        <span title="path/to/receipt.pdf" class>receipt.pdf</span>

    `.Column.attrs` keys ``a`` and ``span`` can be used to add additional attributes.

    Arguments:
        verify_exists (bool): attempt to determine if the file exists
            If *verify_exists*, the HTML class ``exists`` or ``missing`` is
            added to the element to indicate the integrity of the storage.
        text (str or callable): Either static text, or a callable. If set, this
            will be used to render the text inside the link instead of
            the file's ``basename`` (default)
